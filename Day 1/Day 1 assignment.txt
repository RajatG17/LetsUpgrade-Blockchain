   c) Enhanced Security
   d) Tamper proof

4) What all things does a block contain ?

   Mining Key

5) How verifiability of Blockchain has been attained?
=> The data is stored across multiple sites throughout the internet. If any discrepency is observed at 
   a particular site then it can be rectified by verifying data at other sites. In this way verifiability
   is achieved.
	Data = key0
    	key0+New Data = key1
	key1+New Data = key2
   	 and so on.
